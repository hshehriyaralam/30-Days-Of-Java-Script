/*
 Feature Request 
 01) * Variables Types Console Log*
 When I declare all Data Types in variables and console with "typeof" get the result is 
 strings Data type is Strings 
 Number Data type is Numbers
 Boolean Data type is Boolean 
 But Array Data Type is Object
 and Object Data Type is Object.



02) *Reassigment Demo*
When I Decalre variables using let , const and var
Shocking things is var Allow to Reassign and Reinitialize
But Let only allow Reassign 
and const are don't allow to Reassign and Reinitialize
const with the time of Reinitialize show Error in Code Editior
But with the time of Reassign don't show error in Code Editor But When I run code browser and Node Enviroment Show the Error 




********************************* Achievments *****************************
01) know how to declare variables using var, let and const
02) Understand the different data Types in Java Script
03) Be able to use the typeof Operators to identify the data types of a variable
04) Understand the concept of variable reassinment and the immutability of const variables
